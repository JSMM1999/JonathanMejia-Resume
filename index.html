        <p class="lead mb-4">Being a first generation immigrant and college student in the US has largely shaped my personal goals and aspirations. Coming from a very poor country, my hopes and dreams were always limited by the countryâ€™s economy. However, once I started living in the US, I had my mind opened and started to dream and aspire more. Although English was not my first language, I had some background with it, since I attended an English-teaching school during elementary, middle, and most part of high school. I did finished my high school education here in the US and I am still furthering my education at University of California Riverside. 

During my first year of college, I explored the different opportunities that this country offers. I came to realize that the things I was told that were next to impossible to achieve, they were reachable. Now more than ever, I really wanted to reach those goals not only for my personal satisfaction but with the goal of helping my parents and sister. I understand how it feels to be financially challenged and without opportunity which is why I go above and beyond when an opportunity arises. Life has taught me to seek out opportunities regardless of how risky they might be. I take great pride in persistence, diligence, and empathy.
<br><br>

        My first working experience was at a Jack in the Box, and even though it was not the best experience, I am really thankful for the chance they gave me to not only start my working life but also to help me provide to my family in what was our most difficult economic situation. Because of that opportunity, I also was able to cover my college expenses. During my time with Jack in The Box, I developed my social skills, perfected my English and learn how to handle different types of people. Within the company, I was able to move up from a cashier, to supervisor, to assistant manager of the store in a year. 

After working with Jack in The Box for two and a half years, I decided that I needed to focus completely in school. By doing this, I was able to finish what was left of my college education in one year. While on my last semester in college, I started to apply to different jobs. Within a week, a medical supply company contacted me to offer a customer service position so I took it mostly for the experience. However, I kept looking for a better paying job. After a month of working at this medical supply, a franchisee owner contacted me to offer a position of shift lead at a new store he was opening. The pay was better, so I quit from the medical supply company and went to this Jersey Mikeâ€™s store. This was probably the best decision I had made careerwise. 
<br><br>

        At Jersey Mikeâ€™s, I was able to put in practice all of the experience I had gained while also getting a very decent pay. I did my best in this job and tried to learn all that I could and within 4 months, I was promoted to manager of the store. I was happy with the achievement but I wanted more. That is why, I am currently at University of California Riverside getting my Bachelorâ€™s in Economics/Administrative Studies to keep on moving up the latter of life and continue achieving personal and career goals.
